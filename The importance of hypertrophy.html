        <h1>Why Going to the Gym to Build Muscle is Important</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <h2>Key Terms</h2>
        <p>Hypertrophy: The building of muscle tissue due to the increase in size of muscle cells, caused by the cycle of breaking down and rebuilding muscle fibres.</p>
        <p>Base Metabolic Rate(BMR): The minimum amount of energy(calories) your body uses up for basic functions like breathing.</p>

        <h2>1. Increases Strength and Endurance</h2>
        <p>As you build muscle, you increase your body's overall strength and stamina. This means you'll feel more energized throughout the day and have the ability to handle physical tasks with ease, whether it's lifting groceries or carrying heavy objects. It also means you will be less vulnerable to an attack and are more capable of protecting your family/loved ones.</p>

        <h2>2. Boosts Mental Health</h2>
        <p>Exercise is known to release endorphins, chemicals that make you feel good. This helps reduce stress, leading to improved mood and mental clarity. Looking better can also make you feel more confident.</p>

        <h2>3. Enhances Metabolism</h2>
        <p>Hypertrophy increases your BMR, meaning you'll burn more calories even at rest. This allows you more space in your diet to eat the foods that make you happy and that you enjoy.</p>

        <h2>4. Promotes Longevity</h2>
        <p>Muscle mass naturally declines with age, but regular strength training helps combat this process, keeping you more agile, mobile, and independent as you get older. It can also help you live a longer, healthier life.</p>

        <h2>5. Improves your Looks</h2>
        <p>Regular working out can make you appear younger. A healthy amount of muscle mass is also seen as more attractive. This can improve your self-confidence and happiness in life. It can also make you less likely to be seen as a target for a crime (such as a robbery, attack or kidnapping).</p>
